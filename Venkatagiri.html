        Most individuals are visiting the temple near the beach. Normally individuals go to the Pooja, and then they go to the water holy. Very nice beach. Not so profound waves, not so large. Unlike other Nellore beaches, although some people go fishing, this beach doesn’t smell bad. From the store’s close beach, there is plenty of food choice, and they serve you a range of fish, carbs, and Prawns. There are a few bathrooms, but they charge you Rs 10 per person. APTDC also provides the same, but APTDC’s rooms are very smooth and well-preserved compared to the exterior rooms. There are no shelters around the beach, but Govt provided the benches close to it.</p>
