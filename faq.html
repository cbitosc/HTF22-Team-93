        <br><br>
        <h1 style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">1. Is there a requirement of proof of COVID-19 vaccination?</h1>
        <p style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">Travellers are required to produce proof of COVID-19 vaccination on all of our trips. For those travelling on Urban Adventures tours, see specific details on the Urban Adventures site.

            If you are unable to be vaccinated for medical reasons, you may apply for an exemption. Exemptions will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. To apply, you must provide a medical certificate from a medical professional.  
            
            Children under 18 are exempt. Children aged between 5 and 17 years old must provide proof of either vaccination, recovery or a negative COVID-19 test. Please see the below section on children for further details.</p>
        <br>
        <h1 style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">2. Will my trip continue if someone on the trip tests positive for COVID-19?</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">If a customer tests positive for COVID-19, they will be assisted to leave the trip and access medical care (if required).

            Depending on the destination, they may be required to isolate for a period of time. Whether the rest of the group can continue on the trip will be managed on a case by case basis.
            
            Our goal is to keep the trip going wherever possible unless we are required to end the trip in line with local regulations.</p>
            <br>
        <h1 style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">3. If I Come Across Any Problem During My Trip, How Would You Help Me?
        </h1>

        <p style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">We provide truly 24 X 7 assistance. Our office is open 24 hours a day which means that you will always have someone to assist you even at any point of time. We shall also give you mobile nos. of executives who you may call in case of any need .

        </p>
            <br>
        <h1 style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">4.Is rural Indian food and water unhygienic?
        </h1>
        <p style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">  
            NO. It’s not that, living in cities we eat food thats prepackaged and made in our kitchens but our fruits and vegetables are injected at every level with artificial colours and chemicals. On the other hand, villages survive on food grown in a more organic way. The rivers and streams are much cleaner there than here. No wonder how sustainable and organic rural india is!</p>

        <br>
        <h1 style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">5. What about Payment Terms?</h1>
        <p style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">As responsible travellers, anyone who chooses to travel with us has a duty of care to themselves and the people around them. Travellers are required to comply with local regulations and laws, as well as our own health and safety guidelines. 

            We usually need an advance amount once then we will be able to confirm your arrangements for the tour. The amount depends on the services you may require for the tour. This can be paid through bank transfer (before arrival) credit card, traveller’s cheques or cash. We need balance payment before arrival. The exact terms and conditions will be shared at the time of reservation.
        </p>
            <br>
        <h1 style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">6. Can I get a refund if I am unwell before my trip and unable to travel?</h1>

        <p style="text-align:left ;" class="para1">If you are unwell prior to travelling, please stay at home and contact us to make alternative arrangements. Please refer to our Flexible Bookings for the options available to you.</p>
