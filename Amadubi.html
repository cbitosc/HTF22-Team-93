        Pata Chitra is a traditional form practiced by the Paitkar community. Living in Jharkhand, West Bengal, and Odisha, Paitkar is a small community and is both socially and economically marginalized in this region. Traditionally, the Paitkar would earn a living as storytellers, making use of Pata Chitra to tell their stories. Pata Chitra was traditionally made on scrolls of paper. Natural dyes made from fruits, bark, flowers, soil, stones, and leaves were used to color the painting giving the scroll a rich, earthy feel. Popular stories depicted in the Pta Chitra paintings included; Stories of Krishna Leela, Ramayana, Mahabharat, Santhal Utpatti, etc.</p>

        Thanks to a rich forest cover, Jharkhand has an abundance of wood, which is used by people of various tribal groups to make household articles. Some of the exquisite items tourists can buy include wall hangings, key hangers, fruit baskets, utensils, candle stands, flower vases, pen stands and toys. The locals also use wood to make windows, doors, boxes and wooden spoons. The intricately carved designs and patterns of the articles represent the rich tribal heritage of Jharkhand that makes them a great choice for home decor. The tribal communities have a great respect for trees, which is why they use only the branches to create artefacts rather than cutting down the entire tree.</p>

        JAGANNATH TEMPLE
     </h2>
      <img class="subphotol" src="https://i.imgur.com/uUJHU1T.jpg">
      <p class="subparar">
                Located on the outskirts of the city, this temple is one of the most revered sites in the state of Jharkhand. Its architecture looks a lot like the famous Jagannath temple in Odisha's Puri and this expansive white temple can be accessed via a long flight of steps. Since it is located on a hilltop, the climb can be arduous but it is worth getting to the top to get drenched in the spiritual fervour of the place. The scenery from the hilltop is absolutely breathtaking and one can also get a birds eye view of the city of Ranchi. In 1691 AD, the 100-foot-tall temple was constructed by Aninath Shahdeo. On the occasion of Rath Yatra or the Car Festival, lakhs of devotees gather at the temple.</p>
