                Block printing is making use of a carved piece of wood or any other type of wooden block with a pattern to imprint a design on fabric or paper. The craftsmenâ€™s creativity guides them to carve the design stencils on blocks of wood which are then immersed in dyes to absorb the colour. Today the phenomenon of block printing is popularly associated with making designs on fabrics by printing on them, with the help of a block made for that purpose.</p>
