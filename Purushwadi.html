        A place that attracts those in search of some good, old-world charm, for it has swarms of fireflies coming in. Yes, you read that right; this tiny village in Maharashtra, at a drive of some four hours from Mumbai, is the stuff that all good dreams are made of. So much so that Purushwadi also plays host to a Fireflies Festival every year, right when the monsoons are about to hit India.

        Harishchandragad fort is only 35 kilometres away from Purushwadi village. It is the second highest fort of Maharashtra state. Being so near to the fort, we asked Sunil if he could guide us for the trek and he happily agreed. It took us 5 hours in total for the trip to Harishchandragad fort from Purushwadi village. And we were so grateful to our host to have prepared tiffin box for us to carry during the trip. We felt like we went for a picnic just like old school days</p>

        One cannot miss out on watching the fireflies glow during the night in Purushwadi village. The village is not contaminated by artificial light and the glow of fireflies is more prominent in absolute darkness. The number of fireflies that we saw glowing kept on increasing with every blink of our eye. The flickering fireflies decorated our entire path including the trees and the houses. We were left speechless with this beauty of nature. Ask your guide to take you into the fields to spot plenty of fireflies. However fireflies can only be seen in May - June right after first rains and before full monsoon.</p>

                Bhandardara is a hill village in the Western Ghat range and is located very near to Purushwadi village (approximately 33 kilometres). Bhandardara is a famous camping site and youngsters stock here to visit the magnificent Arthur Lake. Like other places in the Western Ghats, Bhandardara is absolutely stunning during and after the rainy season.</p>

        The school and temple are beside each other.You can speak with the headmaster of the school and know his future plans regarding the growth of the children and the education system in Purushwadi village. Parents in the village are mandated to send their children to school each day without fail - hence the girls are not devoid of education as opposed to certain other villages in India where they are only made to do household work. The school in Purushwadi also provides healthy food to all the students - which is another initiative to ensure that no child skips school. It was also interesting to know that the school has a digital classroom where the students are taught computer.</p>
