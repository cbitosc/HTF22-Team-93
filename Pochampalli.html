        Pochampalli, a 28-square km weavers hamlet on the outskirts of Hyderabad, has been catapulted onto the global stage after bagging the 'Best World Tourism Village’ tag awarded by United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO). The village is a shimmering pleats of colour with billboards of silk sarees, cotton fabrics and phone numbers.
As vehicles turn left from the Hyderabad highway and enter the MG Road leading to the Pochampally village, signs of development are immediately apparent. Farm lands have been filled up, hills have been cleared for housing plots, layouts dot the landscape.

        The main street is lined with shops advertising Pochampally Ikat, bedspreads, and the street doesn’t seem to end. Outside the shops are swanky cars and SUVs driven from Hyderabad and other places. “This is nothing. On Saturday and Sundays, we cannot even talk. People come from other States too for festival and wedding shopping,” says Satyanarayana, secretary of the biggest shopping complex in the village.
While some shoppers are happy to pick and choose at the shops, the more fashion conscious seek out the weavers as they work their magic in the looms inside their homes.</p>

        The 101 Darwaja House is an interesting piece of heritage building in the town of Pochampally. The building is believed to be at least 150 years old and was constructed by the Village Revenue Chief. The house has been named so because of the 101 doors and windows built in the building that all open to scenic views. The building is a favourite with the tourists who are keen to see for themselves a house with so many openings.</p>

                Vinobha Mandir is actually an ashram that is dedicated to Vinobha Bhave, the man who ushered in the Bhoodan Movement in India. The ashram is now very significant from the religious point of view and is therefore, referred to as a temple. The temple holds plenty of importance for the people of Pochampally as this was the place where the historical Bhoodan movement was launched. Inside the temple are the statues of Acharya Vinobha Bhave and Shri Vedire Ramchendra Reddy, the man who was the first to donate his land to the poor.</p>

        This is the lake serving the farming needs of local farmers beneath the project. On the bank of this lake, famous KATTA MISAMMA temple is located on the way to Revanapally Village. The Lake's infrastructure has going to be developed by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Corporation & new boats & lake view facilities are introduced along with providing street lights along side of the lake. But so far no positive action has been taken in this regard. Soon it is going to be recognized as World Heritage Center.</p>
